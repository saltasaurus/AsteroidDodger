# Asteroid Dodger
On a mission to save humanity, you must train the next generation of star pilots!

## Fly the ship! 🚀
Using your mouse, direct the ship's navigation system around space. Careful though, those asteroids aren't friendly!

## Asteroids 🪨
As humanity explores new worlds and even new solar systems, asteroids are our main enemy out there.\
The aliens are a problem too, but there's many more asteroids!

## Your time to shine ☀️
With every run through the asteroid simulator, our cadets get better and better. \
How far will you get?
